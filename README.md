## TESTING

This project uses Vitest along with React Testing Library for unit tests.

### Running Tests

To run all tests, execute:

```bash
npm run test
```

## CI/CD

This project uses **GitHub Actions** for continuous integration and **Vercel** for continuous deployment. The workflow is defined in [`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`](./.github/workflows/deploy.yml) and is triggered on every push to the `dev` branch. Here‚Äôs how it works:

1. **Install Dependencies**  
   The workflow checks out the repository and installs all necessary dependencies via `npm install`.

2. **Run Tests**  
   Before building, it runs the tests using Jest (`npm run test`). If any test fails, the process stops and the deployment does not proceed.

3. **Build the Project**  
   If the tests pass, the workflow executes the build script (`npm run build`), which compiles TypeScript and bundles the app with Vite.

4. **Deploy to Vercel**  
   Finally, it deploys the built project to Vercel using the [amondnet/vercel-action](https://github.com/amondnet/vercel-action).  
   - Deployment credentials (like `VERCEL_TOKEN`, `VERCEL_ORG_ID`, and `VERCEL_PROJECT_ID`) are stored as **GitHub repository secrets**.
